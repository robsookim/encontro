# encontro

An interactive, agenda-focused meeting app which allows users to join meetings, chat, take notes, raise silent concerns, etc. The app stores the agenda and notes for users to access at a later date. 

Too often are meetings ineffective because the items discussed are quickly discarded from the minds of the attendees. This app makes the meeting more memorable by promoting participation, and allows a user to access the notes at any time.
